# Twitter Ad Blocker for Firefox
Remove ads from twitter

I'm not sticking this on the Firefox Extensions page as the Twitter HTML layout is bound to 
change from time to time, and I just don't want to maintain the (naive) code to match.

<ul>
    <li>Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox on firefox</li>
    <li>Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."</li>
    <li>Locate the manifest.json file</li>
    <li>edit the kill_ads.js file for fun, and hit reload on the firefox plugin settings page</li>
</ul>
